230718:
Python的简洁做法是用collections.SortedDict
本质是结合双向链表和哈希表
需要注意的是每一次get和put操作之后, order都会发生变化
比如: new LRUCache(2)
put(1, 1) => cache is {1=1}
put(2, 2) => cache is {1=1, 2=2}
get(1) => return 1 ({2=2, 1=1})
put(3, 3) => LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
get(2) => returns -1
put(4, 4) => LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {3=3, 4=4}
(注意这里Example 1的解释有误: "cache is {4=4, 3=3}" (应该是{3=3, 4=4}))
